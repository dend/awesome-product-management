# Contribution Guidelines

Please note that this project is released with a [Contributor Code of Conduct](code-of-conduct.md). By participating in this project you agree to abide by its terms.

## Adding items to the list

If you have something awesome to contribute to the list, simply [fork the repository](https://help.github.com/en/articles/fork-a-repo), make your changes, and [submit a pull request](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-pull-request).

Some general guidelines to consider:

- Please ensure your pull request adheres to the existing list format.
- Do not include links to resources that can be considered inappropriate, malicious or deceitful.
- Do not include links to pay-walled content.
- This list is not for self-promotion - posting links to your own articles is generally frowned upon (_we can assess those PRs on a case-by-case basis_).
- The list is not an advertising surface. It's not about pitching the latest productivity SaaS product, but rather about tools that are _genuinely_ helpful for product/program managers.
- Make sure that the links you submit are working correctly. Pages that are not loading/resulting in errors will be removed.
