# Awesome Product Management [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge-flat2.svg)](https://awesome.re)

A curated list of awesome resources for product/program managers to learn and grow. 

## Who's a product manager?

By definition, a product manager is an individual who drives the product vision and has a deep understanding of customer needs. PMs generally are considered to be at the intersection of the business, technology and and design spaces - they are the experts in the problem space, and are able to learn and iterate quickly to deliver valuable experiences to consumers.

## Tools

In day-to-day activities, product managers need to rely on tools to help them make sense of the information and insights they're handling. The list below represents _some_ of those tools. A product manager doesn't need to use every single one of them, and neither is one better than the other. These are just pointers to some of the instruments that can be used to be effective at organizing and sharing PM expertise. None of them, standalone, will make one a better product manager.
